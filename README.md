# ROASOD Website (ready)

This folder contains a lightweight static site ready for deployment.

Files added:
- INDEX.HTML — main landing page
- Coming.html — coming soon page
- assets/favicon.svg — simple SVG favicon
- manifest.json — PWA manifest
- robots.txt — default crawler rules (update `Sitemap:`)
- sitemap.xml — placeholder sitemap (replace domain before publishing)

Preview locally: open `INDEX.HTML` in your browser.

Deployment: upload the entire folder to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3, etc.). After deploying, update `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` with your real domain.
